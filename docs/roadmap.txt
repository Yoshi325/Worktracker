WorkTracker 

This is a basic out line of this project. The idea is to inter the heat number 
of a pipe and its related mark number and  information, log it into a SQL 
database, and access the information through a public web address. 

There will be three main parts to this project. The first the GUI. This is 
what the worker will interact with. It must be intuitive, quick, and easy 
to correct. The second is the server backend. This includes the database and 
the code to interact with it. The last is the web interface. This will need 
a secure login to identify the user and determin the ammount of information 
they can access.

GUI:
The GUI will be based off the project I did for pluralsight. That means PYQT. 
I will meed to get the welders initials, the pipe heat number, the plate heat 
number, the time and the date. I want this to update/sync the server DB every 
2 minuites. The device this runs on will have a SQL DB as a back up.

Backend:
The backend will be the same SQL database that is depicted above in the GUI 
section. The front end will needto interact with it

Frontend:
This is what the client will see. It needs to be intuitive and flow. It must be 
near real time sync with the device used in the shop. It will require a login 
before entry to anything.
