#Welcome to WorkTracker

##What is  WorkTracker
WorkTracker consists of two programs `vsm2` and `text2x`. Vsm was made for me to log data relevent to my work and text2x was to turn that data into an .xlsx file. There are other work related projects here most are just prouff of concept projects. All have bugs and issues.

##How to use WorkTracker
Everything was written for Linux so if you use Windows I suggest using a VM such as virtualbox. 


To use open your prefered terminal and navagate into the `Worktracker` directory. Enter `python setup.py install` into the terminal. Once everythng is set up change into th `WorkTracker` directory. Then run `./vsm`, this will start the program and open the GUI. When your finished and want to turn the the `.txt` file into a `.xlsx` run `./text2x`. This opens a GUI where you can search for your file to convert.
